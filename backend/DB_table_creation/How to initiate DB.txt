Reasoning for Dublicating Files:
I encountered problems with importing files from the parent directory
when trying to run 'backend_pre_start.py' and 'initial_data.py'.
Strangely enough, when I enter 'uvicorn app.main:app --reload',
there are no such problems. After some time, I decided to take
an easy way out and just duplicated the files needed to run
those two Python files mentioned above.

Now that the thought process for dublicating files is explained,
it's time for instructions on how to create DB tables:
1. Create a database and call it 'app' in pgAdmin4.
2. Run initial_data.py.
