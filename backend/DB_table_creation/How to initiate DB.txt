Reasoning for dublicating files:
Because of problems with importing files from parent directory.
I encountered them when I tried to run 'backend_pre_start.py'
and 'initial_data.py'. Strangely enough, when I enter 
'uvicorn app.main:app --reload', there are no such
problems. Thus, after some time, I decided to follow an easy way
and just dublicate the files needed to run those two python
files mentioned above.

Now that thought process for making dublicate files
is explained, time for instructions of how to create DB tables
1. Create DB and call it 'app' in pgAdmin4
2. Run initial_data.py
